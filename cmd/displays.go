var displaysCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "displays",
	Short: "All commands for interacting with your displays",
	Long: `Description: The 'display' command contains all the commands for interacting with your display displays.

Scripts are from 'displays.location' in your config. I like to use ~/.screenlayout/

Each script is a shell script created by aRandR (a GUI for RandR).
RandR is a CLI for setting screen orientation, resolution, and rotation. With aRandR
you can visualy orient your displays. Use aRandR to save the layout to a shell script
then call this script to apply it to your system.

Sometimes when you re-plugin displays to your graphics card, it can
invalidate your layout made with aRandR. It's a real annoyance that I don't have a
fix for right now. You will have to recreate the layout and re-run 'dot screen select'`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(displaysCmd)
}
